This IOC is created from .proto and .db files I have recieved from Pierrick M Hanlet, APS along with the set of edm screens.
Original .proto and .db were created by Pete Owens, and later modified by Pierrick and co. They added delays and removed some records. 
.opi files have been creatred by edm2opi utility included in CSS studio from SNS. The following have been manualy edited: shrift on all text widgets changed from "1|helverica|18|1|GTK|1|" to "default", action buttons' mode to "workbench tab". The original " stand alone" was causing NSLS2 CSS version to crash. It did not do so in SNS version.
